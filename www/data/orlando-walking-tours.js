Foster laid out plantings to preserve native plants and planted trees and shrubs bearing berries to encourage a bird sanctuary. Local groups including The Orlando Garden Club, First Methodist Church, employees of Landmark Image Date listed Narrative Dickson Ives Department Store, and the Sentinel Star newspaper adopted plots within the park to beautify. They dedicated H.H. Dickson Azalea Park on February 21, 1937, honoring Henry Hill Dickson, a pioneer Orlando businessman and advocate of the City’s beautification.

Here, he wrote the book’s follow-up The Dharma Bums in twelve days using a rented typewriter and a roll of teletype paper taped together as a continuous scroll. Because the home had no air conditioning, Kerouac mostly wrote at night or underneath the large oak in the backyard. Having arrived penniless and renting the home with his mother, he left for New York in 1958 as a famous American writer. Today, the property is managed by the Jack Kerouac Writer in Residence Project of Orlando, a nonprofit group that opens the home to a writer or poet to live and write, rent free. In 1998, the group renovated the c. 1920 Frame Vernacular house to look like it did when Kerouac lived there.

Curved brick steps lead to the original double wood doors.
